## How to use

* Download the required files for your desired OS 
* Check whether you have already installed the browser used in each option 
  * GNU/Linux -> Mozilla Firefox
  * Windows -> Google Chrome
  * Alternatively you can use other browsers, but check Selenium page for documentation and instructions
    on how to install webdrivers: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
* Install Selenium package on Python using pip
* Enjoy!!!

## Recommended setup

Although you can run the scraper on its own, it is highly recommended that you run it using any kind of task scheduler such as crontab in GNU/Linux. 

## How to set up task scheduler in GNU/Linux

* Use the command `crontab -e` in order to add a new rule to the scheduler
* Add a new rule such as: 

```
SHELL=/bin/bash

8-23,0-3 * * * DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/python3 /home/alvar/Documentos/Scraper/linux_scraper_se.py >> /home/alvar/Documentos/Scraper/log.out
```

* It is very important that you use absolute paths and avoid using environment variables. If that is not the case the script won´t be executed properly
* For more information on how to set time intervals check this page: https://crontab.guru/
